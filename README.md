# stock-sentiment-analysis
 Stock sentiment analysis basically contains data regarding the top 25 headlines of companies on that particular day and it's influence on stock which is labelled as 0 and 1 where 0 stands for 'negative' influence and 1 stands for 'positive' influence.
So, the dependant variable of this case study is label variable and the independant variables are top 25 features.
I have initially loaded the data into dataframe using pandas framework and then splitted the data into datasets i.e train and test datasets.Train dataset contains information of companies before 01/01/2015 and test dataset contains data of the same after 12/31/2014.
